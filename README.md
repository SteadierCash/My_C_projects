This repository contains various C projects that I've worked on.

## Project Descriptions:

### 1. Data Encryption and Decryption
   - **Description**: This project provides functionality to encrypt and decrypt data from a text file using a specified encryption algorithm.

   - **Usage**:
      - To encrypt data from a text file:
       ```bash
       ./encrypt encrypt
       ```

     - To decrypt data from an encrypted text file:
      ```bash
      ./encrypt decrypt 
      ```

### 2. image (*project in progress*)
   - **Description**: This project is a simple JPEG file parser implemented in C. It parses JPEG files to extract basic information such as image dimensions (width and height) and comments embedded within the file. 


### 3. socket (*project in progress*)
   - **Description**: This project explores socket programming in the C programming language.

### 4. Tideman Algorithm
   - **Description**: This project implements the Tideman algorithm.
   - **Usage**:
       ```bash
       ./tideman [name1] [name2] ...
       ```
